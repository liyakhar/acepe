# Acepe Monetization Direction

## Problem Frame

Acepe has product differentiation and early user signal, but the monetization path is still fuzzy. The current public pricing page proposes Free / Premium / Enterprise, yet the strongest product value appears to be operational control over multi-agent development work rather than convenience add-ons for solo users. Acepe also is not fully proprietary today: the repository is licensed under FSL-1.1-ALv2, which is source-available rather than fully closed. The monetization strategy needs to decide who pays first, what they pay for, and whether closing the product would actually improve odds of success.

## Requirements

**Customer and Value Wedge**
- R1. The strategy must identify the most likely first paying customer.
- R2. The monetization wedge should be aligned with Acepe's strongest differentiated value, not generic editor convenience.
- R3. The paid wedge should be based on operationalizing multi-agent work — visibility, coordination, control, reviewability, or governance — rather than just access to a local desktop client.

**Packaging Direction**
- R4. The local/single-player product should remain generous so adoption and trust are not choked off too early.
- R5. The first serious paid offer should target teams rather than assuming casual solo users will sustain the business.
- R6. Enterprise should be treated as the upscale version of the team wedge, not as a disconnected parallel strategy.

**Source Strategy**
- R7. The monetization strategy must account for the current FSL-1.1-ALv2 license posture: Acepe is already source-available, not fully closed.
- R8. The recommendation should explicitly answer whether Acepe should stay public/source-available, move more closed, or lean further into open-core.
- R9. Any source strategy should support adoption and trust unless there is strong evidence that code visibility is the main monetization blocker.

**Execution and Learning**
- R10. The strategy should avoid pretending current pricing is validated.
- R11. The next step should be learning-focused: willingness-to-pay discovery before hardening exact pricing and packaging.

## Success Criteria
- Acepe has a clear hypothesis for who pays first.
- The paid wedge is tied to differentiated product value rather than generic SaaS wishlists.
- The source-available vs closed-source decision is grounded in monetization logic, not instinct.
- The current pricing page can be evaluated against a real strategy instead of remaining a placeholder.

## Scope Boundaries
- This brainstorm does not need final prices.
- This brainstorm does not need a detailed financial model.
- This brainstorm does not need a final legal relicensing plan.

## Key Decisions
- First paying customer hypothesis: small engineering teams are the most plausible first paying customer.
- Monetization wedge: Acepe should monetize team-managed agent workflows — shared visibility, remote/cloud execution, handoffs, approvals, review flows, auditability, and policy/governance — rather than basic local use.
- Source posture recommendation: do not make Acepe fully closed right now. The repo is already source-available under FSL, which preserves code visibility while limiting competing commercial use.
- Packaging direction: keep local/solo usage highly accessible, and make team/enterprise layers the monetization focus.
- Pricing-page caveat: the current Free / $20 Premium / Enterprise page is a hypothesis, not evidence-backed strategy, and likely underweights the team/governance wedge.

## Dependencies / Assumptions
- Current public pricing suggests Premium includes cloud sync, integrations, and mobile access, but this may be too weak to be the primary reason users pay.
- Current comparison and FAQ copy position Acepe around the operator layer: attention queue, checkpoints, richer session context, SQL Studio, and session control.

## Outstanding Questions

### Deferred to Planning
- [Affects R1][Needs research] Which current users most resemble a first paying customer: solo power users, small teams, or larger orgs?
- [Affects R2][Needs research] Which value wedge creates the highest willingness to pay: cloud execution, shared coordination, review/approval workflows, governance, or analytics?
- [Affects R7][Needs research] How much does public/source-available code materially contribute to trust, discovery, and adoption today?
- [Affects R10][Needs research] Which parts of the current pricing page should be kept, softened, or replaced after monetization discovery?

## Next Steps
-> Resume /ce:brainstorm or use pricing-strategy work to pressure-test the team-first monetization thesis before changing pricing or licensing posture
