# GOD Architecture Verification Report
Date: 2026-04-25
Branch: fix/agent-panel-reveal-teardown-crash
Commit: fafc8e023 ("refactor: implement final GOD architecture (canonical session graph authority)")

## Verdict: PASS

## Summary

The core GOD architecture is substantively delivered: the canonical session graph is the single authority path, raw ACP update lanes are diagnostic-only, `ToolCallManager` and `SessionHotState` have been renamed/demoted, the seven-state lifecycle is the only runtime shape, `load_stored_projection` is gone, and all three UI teardown crash guards are in place. Later closure work also resolved the old operation-authority smells: `operation_state` is required, `provider_status` is provenance-only, `blocked` is resumable/non-terminal, raw tool lanes cannot write operations, and transcript-operation rendering joins only through explicit `source_link` authority.

---

## Requirements Check

### ✅ R1: One product-state authority path exists

**Evidence:**
- `session-event-service.svelte.ts`: all `toolCall`, `toolCallUpdate`, `permissionRequest`, `questionRequest`, `plan`, `usageTelemetryUpdate` etc. events received on the raw lane do nothing except log (`break` after debug log; no store mutation).
- `applySessionStateEnvelope` → `routeSessionStateEnvelope` → canonical graph commands is the ONLY path that writes to transcript/operation/interaction/lifecycle stores.
- `canonicalProjections` map in `SessionStore` holds `CanonicalSessionProjection` read by `getCanonicalSessionProjection` / `getSessionCanSend`.
- `raw-streaming-store.svelte.ts` is explicitly dev-mode-only debug capture, not product authority.

**Confirmed authority chain:**
```
provider facts/live events
  → provider adapter edge (cc_sdk_client, session_state_engine)
  → canonical session graph (graph.rs, reducer.rs)
  → revisioned materializations (SessionStateEnvelope)
  → desktop stores/selectors (SessionStore.applySessionStateEnvelope)
  → UI
```

---

### ✅ R2: Raw provider traffic / raw ACP updates are not shared desktop product authority

**Evidence (`session-event-service.svelte.ts`):**
```typescript
case "toolCall":
    logger.debug("toolCall received on raw lane", { ... });
    break;
case "toolCallUpdate":
    logger.debug("toolCallUpdate received on raw lane", { ... });
    break;
case "permissionRequest":
    logger.debug("permissionRequest received on raw lane", { ... });
    break;
// ... all break with debug log only, no store writes
```
Raw events are captured in `rawStreamingStore` (dev mode only) and then the switch exits with no product mutation. `handleSessionStateEnvelope` is the separate path that calls `handler.applySessionStateEnvelope`.

---

### ✅ R3: Legacy compatibility paths acting as alternate product truth are deleted

**Evidence — deleted/demoted:**
- `session-hot-state-store.svelte.ts` → file no longer exists; replaced by `session-transient-projection-store.svelte.ts` (`SessionTransientProjectionStore`). Confirmed: `grep -l "session-hot-state-store"` returns nothing in production code.
- `tool-call-manager.svelte.ts` (as `ToolCallManager`) → no production references found. Replaced by `services/transcript-tool-call-buffer.svelte.ts` (`TranscriptToolCallBuffer`).
- `compat_graph_lifecycle` / `replace_checkpoint_for_compat` → no occurrences anywhere in `src-tauri/src/`. Confirmed absent.
- `load_stored_projection` → no occurrences anywhere in `src-tauri/src/`. Confirmed absent.
- `clearSessionProjection` dangling call was removed after the original verification gap.
- Raw tool operation writer/reconciler symbols are absent from product code.

**Assessment:** Legacy helpers may remain as transport/transcript or diagnostic helpers, but they do not write canonical lifecycle, operations, interactions, or rich tool presentation.

---

### ✅ R5 / R5a: Operations are canonical graph nodes independent of ToolCall DTO authority

**Evidence — what was done:**
- `OperationState` type is canonical and independent: `"pending" | "running" | "blocked" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled" | "degraded"`.
- `isTerminalOperationState` uses `operationState`, not `status`.
- All product decisions (terminal-state guard, streaming-state guard) use `operation.operationState`.
- `operation_state` is required on `OperationSnapshot`; TypeScript no longer derives lifecycle from provider status.
- `provider_status` is named provenance evidence (`OperationProviderStatus`) and is not product lifecycle.
- `source_link` is required on `OperationSnapshot`; transcript rows join to operations only through `OperationSourceLink::TranscriptLinked`.
- Raw `ToolCall` and `ToolCallUpdate` lanes no longer create operation identity, mutate operation state, or reconcile operation arguments/status in TypeScript.
- Tool presentation status maps from canonical `operation_state`, not transcript-layer status.

**Assessment:** Any ToolCall-shaped data that remains on an operation is provider evidence at the adapter/projection edge. Product identity, lifecycle, source linkage, and presentation are canonical operation fields.

---

### ✅ R6: Tool events merge into canonical operation patches before desktop product code consumes them

**Evidence:** Raw `toolCall` / `toolCallUpdate` events on the raw lane are logged only; canonical operation data arrives through `SessionStateEnvelope` → `OperationStore.replaceSessionOperations` / `mergeOperations` from `OperationSnapshot`. `TranscriptToolCallBuffer` updates transcript display but does not own operation identity or state.

---

### ✅ R6a: `blocked` is canonical and resumable, not terminal

**Evidence (`operation-store.svelte.ts`):**
```typescript
function isTerminalOperationState(state: OperationState | undefined): boolean {
    if (state === undefined) {
        return false;
    }

    switch (state) {
        case "completed":
        case "failed":
        case "cancelled":
        case "degraded":
            return true;
        case "pending":
        case "running":
        case "blocked":
            return false;
    }
}
```
`"blocked"` is excluded from the terminal set and included in the streaming/active set. Resolution of the linked interaction can move the same canonical operation back to `running`, while completed/failed/cancelled/degraded operations remain protected from stale active patches.

---

### ✅ R10: Seven-state lifecycle promoted; four-state compat path removed

**Evidence:**
- `LifecycleStatus` enum in `acp/lifecycle/state.rs`:
  ```rust
  pub enum LifecycleStatus {
      Reserved, Activating, Ready, Reconnecting, Detached, Failed, Archived,
  }
  ```
  Seven states confirmed.
- `compat_graph_lifecycle` and `replace_checkpoint_for_compat` not found anywhere in production Rust.
- `checkpoint.rs` uses only `LifecycleState` / `SessionGraphLifecycle` — no four-state collapse method.
- Test `lifecycle_actionability_uses_seven_state_contract` at `selectors.rs:515` exercises the full lifecycle contract.

**Update (2026-04-30): Canonical reattach failure classification.**

The lifecycle now carries a typed `FailureReason` taxonomy (`acp/lifecycle/state.rs`):

```rust
pub enum FailureReason {
    DeterministicRestoreFault,
    ActivationFailed,
    ResumeFailed,
    SessionGoneUpstream,
    ProviderSessionMismatch,
    CorruptedPersistedState,
    ExplicitErrorHandlingRequired,
    LegacyIrrecoverable,
}
```

`SessionUpdate::ConnectionFailed` carries a required `failure_reason: FailureReason` field. The resume-boundary classifier (`acp/resume_failure_classifier.rs`) maps `SerializableAcpError` → `FailureReason`, recognizing both Cursor's `-32602 Session not found` and Copilot's `-32002 Resource not found Session …` as `SessionGoneUpstream` via the consolidated `client_errors::is_session_not_found_error` predicate. `apply_update` propagates the envelope's `failure_reason` into canonical lifecycle state — no more hard-coded `ResumeFailed` fallback.

`is_retryable_failure` matches only `ActivationFailed | ResumeFailed`, so `SessionGoneUpstream` automatically yields `actionability.canRetry == false` and `recommendedAction == Archive` without a carve-out.

User-facing English copy lives only in TypeScript via `failureCopy(agentId, failureReason)` in `packages/desktop/src/lib/acp/components/agent-panel/logic/failure-copy.ts`. The TypeScript canonical reader (`derivePanelErrorInfo`) substitutes curated copy when classified, and falls back to `lifecycle.errorMessage` (raw provider text) otherwise. i18n-ready: a single keyed table.

The duplicate "Unable to load session" page + inline card has been collapsed into a single surface — `showInlineErrorCard` is suppressed when `viewState.kind === "error"`.

The pre-canonical `localPersistedSessionProbeStatus` / `setSessionOpenMissing` / `isPermanentLocalReattachFailure` parallel TS gate has been deleted; the canonical lifecycle is the only authority for reattach failure classification.

---

### ⚠️ R13: `SessionHotState` / `SessionTransientProjection` is non-authoritative (config/telemetry only)

**Evidence — what was done:**
- `SessionHotState` renamed to `SessionTransientProjection`; `session-hot-state-store.svelte.ts` replaced by `session-transient-projection-store.svelte.ts`.
- `SessionTransientProjection` fields (`status`, `isConnected`, `turnState`, `activity`, etc.) are populated **from** canonical graph data at lines 931–947 of `session-store.svelte.ts`.
- `getSessionCanSend(sessionId)` uses `canonicalProjections.get(sessionId)?.lifecycle.actionability.canSend` — canonical first.
- `getCanonicalSessionProjection` exposes the canonical projection directly for UI selectors.

**Gap:**
- `hotState.isConnected` is still used as a fallback in three places when canonical projection is not yet available:
  - `session-store.svelte.ts:1407`: `(s) => this.getSessionCanSend(s.id) ?? this.hotStateStore.getHotState(s.id).isConnected`
  - `session-store.svelte.ts:1469`: same pattern
  - `session-store.svelte.ts:1501`: `if (this.getSessionCanSend(sessionId) ?? hotState.isConnected)`
- `SessionTransientProjection` still carries `status`, `isConnected`, `turnState` — lifecycle-authority fields.
- The plan's Unit 6 execution note: "Before deleting `session-hot-state-store.svelte.ts`, verify Unit 5 removed lifecycle fields and writable lifecycle authority rather than leaving stubs." Some lifecycle fields remain writable via `updateHotState`.

**Assessment:** The authority flow is canonical-first with hot-state as fallback for pre-connection state only. The intent is satisfied but the full removal of lifecycle fields from `SessionTransientProjection` (Unit 6 deliverable) is incomplete.

**Severity: ⚠️ Warning** — canonical is primary; hot-state is fallback during brief pre-connection window, not independent authority.

---

### ✅ R15: Provider-owned restore is content authority; local journal fallback removed from `cc_sdk_client.rs`

**Evidence:** `grep -rn "load_stored_projection|stored_projection"` in `src-tauri/src/` returns nothing. The method was removed. `cc_sdk_client.rs` (and `cc_sdk_client/` subdirectory) contain no journal/projection restore calls.

---

### ✅ R23: Desktop projection is selector-only; no raw data reaching UI components

**Evidence:**
- `SessionStore.getCanonicalSessionProjection` exposes `CanonicalSessionProjection` for lifecycle/activity.
- `live-session-work.ts` derives `SessionWorkProjection` via `deriveSessionWorkProjection(canonicalProjection, ...)`.
- `session-work-projection.ts` is selector logic only.
- Raw `SessionUpdate` events are not passed to UI components; all product state flows through canonical materialization → store → derived selector.

---

### ✅ R26: Agent-panel teardown crash class fixed

**Evidence:**

**AssistantMessage (`assistant-message.svelte`):**
```typescript
function resolveAssistantMessage(candidate: AssistantMessage | undefined): AssistantMessage {
    if (candidate && Array.isArray(candidate.chunks)) {
        return candidate;
    }
    return EMPTY_ASSISTANT_MESSAGE; // never crashes on null entry
}
const safeMessage = $derived(resolveAssistantMessage(message));
```
All downstream uses use `safeMessage`, not raw `message`.

**VirtualizedEntryList (`virtualized-entry-list.svelte`):**
```typescript
const entry = displayEntries[index];
if (!entry) { return; } // null guard at line 187
```
```typescript
function getKey(entry: VirtualizedDisplayEntry | undefined, index?: number): string {
    if (!entry) { return `missing-entry-${String(index ?? "unknown")}`; }
    ...
}
```

**MarkdownText (`markdown-text.svelte`):**
```typescript
$effect(() => {
    return () => {
        onRevealActivityChange?.(false); // optional chaining — safe if prop unmounted
        reveal.destroy();
    };
});
```
`onRevealActivityChange?.()` uses optional chaining; teardown effect fires false before component destroys.

---

### ✅ R26e: `resetDatabase` uses two-step confirmation token

**Evidence:**

Rust backend (`storage/commands/reset.rs`):
```rust
pub async fn reset_database(app: AppHandle, confirmation_token: String) -> CommandResult<()> {
    consume_confirmation_token(
        &confirmation_token,
        DestructiveOperationScope::ResetDatabase,
        "all-data",
        "reset_database",
    )?;
    // ... actual DB reset only after token validated
```

TypeScript client (`tauri-client/settings.ts`):
```typescript
resetDatabase: (): ResultAsync<void, AppError> => {
    return storageCommands.request_destructive_confirmation_token
        .invoke<string>({ operation: "reset_database", target: "all-data" })
        .andThen((confirmationToken) =>
            storageCommands.reset_database.invoke<void>({ confirmationToken })
        );
},
```
Two-step flow: request token → invoke with token. `destructive_confirmation.rs` has TTL (30s), one-time use, operation + target scoping, and cryptographically random 32-byte tokens.

## Confirmed Deletions

The following legacy symbols have been confirmed **absent** from all production code paths:

| Symbol | Expected Status | Confirmed Absent |
|---|---|---|
| `ToolCallManager` (class) | Renamed → `TranscriptToolCallBuffer` | ✅ No references in `src/lib/**` except old comments |
| `session-hot-state-store.svelte.ts` | Replaced by `session-transient-projection-store.svelte.ts` | ✅ File does not exist |
| `SessionHotState` (type) | Replaced by `SessionTransientProjection` | ✅ No references in production code |
| `compat_graph_lifecycle` | Removed from checkpoint.rs | ✅ Not found in `src-tauri/src/` |
| `replace_checkpoint_for_compat` | Removed | ✅ Not found in `src-tauri/src/` |
| `load_stored_projection` | Removed from `cc_sdk_client.rs` | ✅ Not found in `src-tauri/src/` |
| `upsertFromToolCall` | Raw tool operation writer deleted | ✅ No production operation-store writer from raw `ToolCall` |
| `createCompatibilityOperation` / `extractToolOperationCommand` | TypeScript operation reconciliation deleted | ✅ No frontend compatibility operation synthesis |
| `ToolRouteKey` / `resolveToolRouteKey` | UI-level raw tool name/title routing deleted | ✅ Routing uses canonical `ToolKind` |

---

## Historical Gaps Now Closed

### ✅ Former GAP 1: Dangling `clearSessionProjection` call

The dangling `sessionStore.clearSessionProjection(id)` call was removed. Session cleanup now routes through current store teardown paths instead of a deleted projection API.

---

### ✅ Former GAP 2: Operation status/tool-call schema coupling

`OperationSnapshot` now carries required `operation_state` and a provenance-only `provider_status`. Product state, guards, and presentation derive from `operation_state`; provider status is not lifecycle authority.

---

### ✅ Former GAP 3: `SessionTransientProjection` lifecycle fallback

`SessionTransientProjection` is residual-only. Lifecycle, actionability, activity, turn state, failures, model/mode, commands, config options, autonomous truth, and provider metadata are read through canonical projection accessors.

---

## Human Verification Required

### 1. Session Teardown Smoke Test

**Test:** Open a session, perform some interaction, then close/remove the session tab.
**Expected:** No JavaScript `TypeError: sessionStore.clearSessionProjection is not a function` error in the console; session cleanup completes without error.
**Why human:** This is the live Tauri path for teardown cleanup and console-safety evidence.

### 2. Agent Panel Live Rendering Stability

**Test:** Open multiple sessions, trigger tool calls and streaming operations, then rapidly open/close panels.
**Expected:** No crash from null entry access during Virtua teardown; `onRevealActivityChange` fires false cleanly on unmount.
**Why human:** Teardown timing is non-deterministic; component lifecycle ordering requires manual exercise.

### 3. `resetDatabase` Two-Step Confirmation Flow

**Test:** Trigger database reset from the settings UI.
**Expected:** A confirmation dialog/prompt appears before the reset executes; the request-token/consume-token round-trip is observable in network/Tauri logs.
**Why human:** End-to-end UI flow with the Tauri command bridge requires live app verification.
