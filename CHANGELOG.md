## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Codex native client now routes `session/update` JSON-RPC notifications through the session update parser, enabling Codex-originated tool calls to appear in the UI
- New sessions can start with Autonomous enabled before the first message, including Codex build sessions mapped to a full-access execution profile
- Config option selector shows a reasoning-effort icon indicator when reasoning level changes
- Markdown streaming sections split and reveal progressively during agent responses instead of updating the entire block
- Project badges can append per-project sequence numbers in agent panel and kanban cards
- Streaming log calls added to Codex native client for debugging event flow
- Contract tests for permission bar, agent-tool-edit, config selector reasoning icon, and resolve-tool-call-edit-diffs
- Markdown streaming now keeps settled sections stable while only the live tail refreshes, including open fenced code blocks
- Kanban board gains a Needs Review column (pink, eye icon) for unseen completions before they move to Done
- Views can override Cmd+T to show a custom new-session flow such as the kanban new-agent dialog
- Cargo profiles for faster Tauri dev builds (opt-level 2 for dependencies) and leaner releases (thin LTO, strip, single codegen unit)
- Biome lint checks added to desktop and website pre-push validation hooks
- ACP file write path handling now canonicalizes and scope-checks write paths for security
- Browser tool cards now separate execute-js scripts from results, and queued-message strips can show removable attachment chips

### Changed
- ACP frontend interaction handling now routes permissions, questions, and plan approvals through shared builders and reply strategies, and feature-specific agent behavior now reads from capability metadata instead of scattered agent-ID checks
- ACP backend now delegates Cursor-specific notification suppression and session-update enrichment through provider hooks, extracts cc-sdk permission bridging into a dedicated module, and threads explicit agent context through session-update, cc-sdk bridge, and streaming parser seams instead of relying on task-local globals
- Tool call edit and permission bar components redesigned with a dedicated diff resolution layer
- Session title formatting extracted to shared `formatSessionTitleForDisplay`, replacing duplicated capitalize-and-fallback logic across agent panel and kanban view
- Website branding now routes through a shared `Logo` component sourced from `favicon.svg`
- App chrome refined with accent border and rounded corners on the main window
- Icon generation now emits website favicon and OG assets from the shared logo source and patches the Android launcher background
- Workspace dependency versions aligned across desktop, website, and ui packages (Vite 7, SvelteKit 2.49, Svelte 5.45, TypeScript 5.9)
- Remaining `once_cell::Lazy` statics replaced with `std::sync::LazyLock` and the direct `once_cell` dependency removed
- Stale `lucide-svelte` and `phosphor-icons-svelte` dependencies removed from manifests and lockfile
- Backend CI serializes Cargo steps and drops redundant `cargo check`
- Website test script uses Bun instead of npm
- Agent setup and kanban activity UI refreshed
- Design system showcase ownership moved into the desktop package
- Kanban inline composer removed in favor of thread dialog interaction
- Main app production chrome now suppresses the native context menu, and kanban-launched session panels open at a wider default width

### Removed
- Analytics and Sentry infrastructure removed across desktop, website, and backend — `@acepe/analytics` package deleted, Sentry SDK dependencies dropped, error capture calls stripped, source map uploads disabled
- Copilot removed from hero section agent grid on the website

### Fixed
- Duplicate ACP approval surfaces no longer appear for the same operation when tool-call cards, permission requests, and hook permissions arrive through overlapping event paths
- Text delta whitespace preserved in Codex native streaming — leading spaces in LLM tokens (e.g. `" world"`) are no longer trimmed, fixing broken inter-word spacing
- Reconnecting a thread with an already-bound ACP session no longer issues a duplicate resume
- Codex turn interrupts now include the active turn id
- Session title overrides now survive transcript refreshes and reveal the latest derived title when cleared
- OpenCode runtime root resolved from the repository or worktree root instead of the raw working directory, preventing duplicate processes and leaked LSP servers
- Open PR button stays visible with its loading spinner during PR creation instead of vanishing instantly
- Website logo dark/light theme assets now display correctly in their respective modes
- Merge split button moved from PrStatusCard to ModifiedFilesHeader for consistent action placement
- PR badges now fetch PR details as soon as they render instead of waiting for hover
- Streaming markdown reuse now preserves settled sections incrementally, avoids refresh reflow churn, and shows elapsed seconds in active thinking headers
- Codex native thread start/resume requests now keep extended-history flags and surface sanitized runtime diagnostics in connection issue drafts
- First-send composer clearing now stays visually immediate while sound/logging work is deferred off the critical path
