# Changelog

All notable changes to Acepe will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Startup restoration now hydrates only the saved sessions first, then refreshes the wider sidebar history in the background
- Preconnection skills are now loaded directly from parsed on-disk agent skill directories grouped by agent
- The global file explorer and inline file picker now prefer the active worktree path and refresh stale indexes when reopened
- Queued messages now render newest-first with inline editing actions and a persistent compact strip above the composer

### Fixed
- Claude Code permission prompts now offer an Always allow path when the SDK suggests persistent rules, and session cancellation now resolves matching pending questions cleanly
- Claude Code sessions now include user, project, and local setting sources when booting the SDK client
- Restored panels now validate missing sessions before reconnecting so startup does not block on a full history scan
- Slash command suggestions now fall back to preconnection skills when a connected session has no live commands yet
- First-send mode and model choices now survive session creation, and busy composer states keep queue and steer actions enabled correctly
- Tool call UI now preserves exit-plan approvals, task child status mapping, markdown reveal placeholders, and fullscreen attached-pane layout behavior more reliably
- Single-session fullscreen now stays scoped to single view mode, keeps terminal fullscreen separate, and restores saved agent fullscreen targets consistently on workspace reload
- Pierre diffs and markdown tables now keep bottom spacing so the last visible content clears overlay scrollbars

## [2026.3.34] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Claude Code permission prompts now queue one at a time above the composer and show batch progress with a compact tally bar

### Fixed
- Direct Claude Code sessions now launch the stdio permission prompt hook reliably so Bash and edit approvals reach Acepe instead of falling back to chat text
- Permission cards now wrap long command previews without overflowing the composer area

## [2026.3.33] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Agent task cards now show the latest tool call inline above the tally strip for faster scanning
- Worktree toggles now keep the primary control visibly disabled when a global auto-worktree default locks it on

### Fixed
- Claude Code session metadata now persists provider-backed session ID aliases so worktree sessions reload the correct history after restart
- History loading, plan lookup, batch upserts, and cleanup now respect provider session IDs instead of treating provider transcripts as separate sessions
- Disabled worktree toggle buttons now dim correctly when interaction is locked

### Changed

- Voice press-and-hold now uses the dedicated keyboard hold flow and warms the audio context earlier so start sounds play with less delay.
- The shared input container is now exported from @acepe/ui and reused by desktop input surfaces for a cleaner shared component path.

### Fixed
