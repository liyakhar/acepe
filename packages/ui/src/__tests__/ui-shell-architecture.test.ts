/**
 * UI shell architecture guard.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Protect the invariant that presentational shells in `@acepe/ui/app-layout`
 *   are dumb and self-contained: they must not transitively import `@tauri-apps/*`,
 *   any desktop store, app-specific runtime, or other forbidden dependency.
 *
 * How it works:
 *   Each shell is imported from the package barrel (`@acepe/ui/app-layout`).
 *   Merely resolving the barrel exercises the whole transitive import graph.
 *   If any shell pulls a forbidden dependency (e.g. a Tauri plugin that only
 *   resolves inside the desktop app), this test file fails to load and the
 *   suite fails — catching architectural drift before it ships.
 *
 * Append pattern:
 *   Units 3, 4, and 5 extend this file by adding new barrel imports at the
 *   top and matching `expect(...).toBeDefined()` assertions inside the
 *   existing `test("shells import without forbidden dependencies", ...)` block
 *   (or appending a new sibling block for a distinct barrel/package).
 *   Do NOT replace or restructure the file — append only.
